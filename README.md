# sfdx-lightning-lib SFDX Project

This project is Work in progress.
Lightning Component Library - collection of LWC and Aura components for Community or App pages to help build Apps in Salesforce platform faster.
Usefull utility base level components with easy design elements to control UI features declaratively will be collected here.
Components intended to be used with Community or App builders. Provided with MIT license free to use including source code as DX project to customize.

I find many managed packages now emerge that provide Components but often these building blocks do not fit a specific app we are building or do not work in a use case. But with minor code change it can fit well, but managed packege code is locked and not possile to change. This project is aim to help in these use cases.
